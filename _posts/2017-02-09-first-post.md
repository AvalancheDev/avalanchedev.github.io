<p>Welcome to the development blog for <a href="https://avalancheoncall.com">Avalanche</a>! Avalanche is a new service, actively in development, that will allow users to order a plow on-demand in their area. Think of it like an Uber but for snow plows. We have a ton of new innovative ideas to completely change the plowing industry using new kinds of technology, some proprietary and some open source. We'll be doing a lot of open source programming for different things that we'll be integrating into our platform. You can keep track of all the new ideas that we have here! We'll post updates periodically about what's in the works, new pieces of software that we find and think people should know about, and other projects and ideas related to Avalanche. Thanks for visiting!</p>
